Using the comments is very important in the programming world as it tell you some information that the different users need to know. However, some information are much worth than others, for example telling the user why some modification was done sometimes more important than how the modifications was done and git commit properly is used to tell the users this kind of information. The good git commit save the efforts and the times  in the collaboration of programming.
There are a general  instruction recommended to follow while writing the git commit message like :

- The number of characters need to be less than 50 characters in the subject line. 
-In the subject line use the first character in the capital letter form.
- Make separation between the body and the subject by blank line.
