# Functions 

Functions in Java Script  allow the user to separate the codes to a parts and use these parts many times by calling.
In addition, the functions make the code much organised and readable.

## How to use the functions in JS :

- You need to declared the function :
The function can be decleared in JS by using the keyword function followed by the name of the function and parentheses contines the premeters of the function for example :

function FunctionName(input1,input2,input3) {

body of the function 

}

depending on the functionality of the code sometimes the function return value in order to be used in another part from the code. 

- Finally, in order to execute the  part of the code inside the function we need to call the function for example :

FunctionName(input1,input2,input3) ;


## Control flow

Control flow is the order in which the computer execute the given code, the execution of the code is done line by line unless there is a statement changes the 
execution order like if statement.

## operators 

Java script provides different types of operators in order to perform the required tasks and functionality, mainly the operators types in JS are :
- Arithmetic Operators like +,-
- Assignment Operators like =,+=
- Logical Operators like && ,||
