## HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow


### HTML lists :

The contents for a given webpages sometimes need to appear in a given style or order, specially when we need to provide a list of related items, HTML supports 
two ways of listing : order listing and unorder listing.

#### Order listing :

order listing is defined  by the open tag < ol >  and the closing tag </ ol > and the different items listed by the open tag < li > and the closing tag </ li >.

#### Unorder listing 

unorder listing is defined  by the open tag < ul >  and the closing tag </ ul > and the different items listed by the open tag < li > and the closing tag </ li >.

# CSS Boxes

The elements in the HTML considered as boxes from the design and the layout point of view, and that box is surrounded by other boxes each of them has its own specifications, 
these boxes are :

-  padding : free space around the content or the element.
-  border : border around the padding.
-  margins :free area around the border.

These models allowed the user to define border between the elements and specify the spacing between the elements, for example  :

div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}

# JS Control Flow

writing a program need to have conditional logic and looping to the given test, JS has many control flow statements for example  (if, for, while) statements

- if statement used to test given condition and then execute given commends and its look like  :

if(condition){
statment_1;
}

else {
statment_2;
}

- while statement it is a basically a loop  it keep executing the statements inside the body of the while until a given condition is no longer is true and it is look like :

 while (condition){
 
 statment_1 ;
 statment_2;
 
 }
 
 
 - while statement it is basically a loop usually used if the number of the execution of the statements is known by specific numbers it is look like :

for (counter ; condition ; counter increment or decrement)

{

statment_1;

statment_2;


}
