## Technical problem 

*Sometimes when we write a code using html for example and we need to concatenate the code we need to use the symbol + and using it many times leads 
to make the code unreadable.The solution would be by defining templating engines such that the template has some place holder and the function call the
get template as prameter, the function finally returns new value in which the place holders were replaced  by the value of the appropriate key.*


## Variables

 *It is a container to save the values, and there is  a rule for naming the variables like :
-Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
-Names must begin with a letter
We use the = assign operator to give the variable value and the vlaue could have number like Value1=10 or could have a string like Value2="Hello".*
