# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM


## Object 

The object in the JS is like the object in the real life, the method and properties are two characteristics for the object.
The object like the variable in JS but the object can have multiple values these value defined as property for example
the mobile can have property like color and  price..... However, the method inside the object is as the function in Js.
we define the object literal :

const ObjectName {
 Property1 : "value";
 Property2 :Value2
 
 Method1 :function(){
 
 }


}

in order to access the object we use the objectname followed by (.) and then the property like  ObjectName.Property  and we use the same way to
access the method of the object. and we use the word this instead of the object name if we need to access the property inside the object itself.


### Document Object Model (DOM)

DOM is a programming interface to modify the HTML document by series of object and the base object.

### - The Document Object :

The document object is the top object in the DOM. It has a properties and methods that can be interacted with it by using the dot (.). In the following some examples
of document object methods :

#### The createElement() method

this method is used to define a spacified element and insert it to the dom.


#### The getElementById() method

This method used to get the element from the document by its id.

### The getElementsByTagname() method

This method is used to access one or more elements by the HTML tag name.
