# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

Designing the website sometimes need to have several pages and in order to move between the different pages so the linking between these pages are required,
the movement could be from page to page by clicking on the web page elements for example (image, hyperlink ..). HTML provide the linking between the pages by the following syntax known as anchor tag  :

< a href = "url" > link text < /a >
where *href* specify the url of the destination page, and the *link text* is the part which is appear to the user when the user click on the user move to the destination page. 


## HTML Layout

HTML has different tags types define the different parts of the webpage for example we have the < header  > specify the header of the document or the section, < section >
defines a section in the documents < footer > define a footer for a document or section, the following image showing the different parts of the webpage and the and some tags 
which could be used for each one.

## HTML Layout Techniques :

- CSS Frameworks : in this way you will design the layout of the webpage very fast.
- CSS Float Layout : it is easy to learn.
- CSS Flexbox Layout advance design layout : it is very useful in the different screen size design.
- CSS Grid Layout : very useful to design the layout of the webpage no need to use floats and positioning.


## Functions, Methods, and Objects


# Function 

Sometimes we have part of the code is repeated many times in the program  in  order to avoid this repetition (which is better from programming point of view) 
JS provide function  which  part of the code contains statements and it can be executed each time by calling the function. the syntax of the function is 

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
 The calling of the function can be done by the name of the function and  by passing the parameters to the function.
  
  
# Object 
  
  The idea of the object in the JS is the same as the object in the real life for example if we have a mobile as object it has its features like colore ,size price and so on
  and the object in the JS has it won variables that are related to the object known as properties, we can define object by Objectname ={property1=value1,property2=value2}
  the properties of the object can be accessed by *objectName.propertyName* .
  
  
  
 # Method 
  The object would also have an method like the properties of the object, methods are stored in properties as function definitions. and it can be accessed by   objectName.methodName().

# Team work 
There are many reasons for team working programming and it can be summarized in the following :

1-improve the communication skills .

2- increase the speed for finding the solution of the problem as the team work in parallel to solve the problem.

3- see others way of programming thinking.

4- it is the way how the most programming company works and that help the student to get be more professional in that method of programming.
