# Expressions and Loops 



### Expressions and operators

 *Each programming language has its own expression and syntax, for example java script has special expressions  that allowed the user to use 
 them in order to write the proper programm, for example if the user would insert an condition to the program or assign value for a given variable.
 Mainly the experssion in JS considered as :* 

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, 
- String: evaluates to a character string, 
- Logical: evaluates to true or false. 
- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

*In addition JS has many operators that perfrom different operation, JS provides the following operators:*

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators


### Loops
Each part of the written programming code has certen functionality. However, sometimes we need to execute part of the codes many times, JS provides looping technique 
in order torepeatedly perfom the code in different ways, the following the main three types of the loop in JS :

- for statement : this statement  repeats execution until certain condition reach to false, usually used when the number of execution is spacified. 
- do...while statement this statement  keeps doing  the execution while the condition is true.The main difference between the do while and the while loop that the do while will execute at the first time without checking the condition 
- while statement this statement keeps execution while the condition is true
